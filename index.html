  <h3>Announcements</h3>
 <p>We have some cool things happening that we want people to know about: this month you can purchase <b>3 drinks for the price of 2</b> at the bar.
First-time party-goers get a <b>50% discount on entry</b><br>
If you get a costume custom made, your next party <b>entry is free</b> if you wear that costume.<br>
Wear your costume in to KFC on Stanton street and you can get a <b>free drink with a 21-piece bucket.</b> All you need to do is tell them you’ve been to CossiePlay!

 <h3>About CossiePlay</h3>
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/p0CxdKl.jpg">
 <p>CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields.
 <br>
 Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and cost between $10 and $10,000.
We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a price list is available) as well.<br>
<br>
On the first Saturday of every month we hold a <b>“CossiePlay Party”</b> at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and <b>kids under 6 are free.</b> 
Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. 
There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required).
